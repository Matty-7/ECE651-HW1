Goal 1: Minimal end to end system
---------------------------------
//Task 0. Project Setup
  You should already have your development environment setup from the previous tutorial.
  We need to make a new gitlab project and create the build.gradle.
  Go to Duke's gitlab, create a new project named
    ece651-sp25-YOURNETID-battleship
  [replace YOURNETID with your netid]
  Now clone that project to your computer.
  cd into that directory (cd ece651-sp25-YOURNETID-battleship)
  and do
  
  gradle init --package edu.duke.YOURNETID.battleship

  (replace YOURNETID with your netid)
  Note: previous versions of Gradle prompted for the package, and the development
  environment setup wasn't updated for this change.   You need to specify --package
  and the name of the package to give a default package

The rest of the Gradle setup is as in the development environment setup:
  - Edit gradle.properties to turn off the configuration cache
    (we did't have this in the writeup this year, but will add in the future)
  - Update your build.gradle to have clover, test logging (show standard streams
  and full exception format), and clover debug info

Before you proceed, run

./gradlew  dependencies

We aren't so much interested in the output, but it will make sure your build.gradle file
is valid, and check the dependency structure.  This mostly will help you identify any problems
before you proceed.


Hooary! You've done task 0 :)
